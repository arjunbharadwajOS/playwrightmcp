## Playwright MCP

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides browser automation capabilities using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev). This server enables LLMs to interact with web pages through structured accessibility snapshots, bypassing the need for screenshots or visually-tuned models.

### Key Features

- **Fast and lightweight**. Uses Playwright's accessibility tree, not pixel-based input.
- **LLM-friendly**. No vision models needed, operates purely on structured data.
- **Deterministic tool application**. Avoids ambiguity common with screenshot-based approaches.

### Requirements
- Node.js 18 or newer
- VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Desktop or any other MCP client

    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@playwright/mcp@latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
